Yes, in the context of Cisco's IP SLA and the associated CISCO-RTTMON-MIB, there is a status of "4". The statuses for rttMonCtrlOperState (which reflects the operational state of an IP SLA operation) are:

Up (1): The operation successfully completed its last run.
Down (2): The operation did not complete successfully on its last attempt.
Unknown (3): The router hasn't yet determined the state, possibly because the operation hasn't been started or another similar reason.
Transition (4): The operation is in a transitional state. This means it's in the process of going from one state to another (e.g., from "Up" to "Down").

If you see a "4" in your Zabbix graphs, it indicates that the IP SLA operation was in a transitional state at that time. This state is temporary and should eventually resolve to one of the other more definitive states.
