I apologize for the oversight. The values you provided are indeed the correct operational states for Cisco's IP SLA when monitoring a website:

1. **Up (1)**: The operation successfully completed its last run.
2. **Down (2)**: The operation did not complete successfully on its last attempt.
3. **Unknown (3)**: The router hasn't yet determined the state, possibly because the operation hasn't been started or another similar reason.
4. **Transition (4)**: The operation is in a transitional state. This means it's in the process of going from one state to another (e.g., from "Up" to "Down").

This information is extracted from the SNMP MIB associated with Cisco's IP SLA operations. Specifically, it's from the `rttMonCtrlOperState` object within the CISCO-RTTMON-MIB. This MIB provides objects for remotely monitoring the availability and response time of various network devices and applications. 

Zabbix, being a network monitoring tool, polls this MIB to retrieve the operational state of the IP SLA operation on your Cisco router.

I apologize for the inconvenience. Here are some other sources that might have the information you're looking for regarding the `CISCO-RTTMON-MIB rttMonCtrlOperState` documentation:

1. [Cisco SNMP Object Navigator](https://snmp.cloudapps.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?local=en&translate=Translate&objectInput=rttMonCtrlOperState) - This link directs to Cisco's SNMP Object Navigator which provides details about SNMP objects.
2. [MIB Depot](https://www.mibdepot.com/cgi-bin/getmib3.cgi?win=mib_a&i=1&n=CISCO-RTTMON-MIB&r=cisco&f=rttmon.mib&v=v2&t=tree) - MIB Depot is a free service that provides vendor-specific MIBs.
3. [OIDView](http://www.oidview.com/mibs/9/CISCO-RTTMON-MIB.html) - OIDView is a MIB database that offers information on SNMP objects.
